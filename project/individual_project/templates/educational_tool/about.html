			<p class="description">
			  Our website is the ultimate learning resource for pre-university students who want to learn how to code! We've curated a collection of cognitive learning resources from across the internet and brought them together in one convenient place to help you master the concepts of programming and coding in Python.

			<p class="description">

			CodeJutsu was developed by Morgan Bierey, a computer scientist who attended the University of Glasgow. Morgan had a passion for programming and a desire to help others learn how to code. He recognized that many high school students had an interest in coding but lacked the resources and support to develop their skills.

			  With this in mind, Morgan set out to create a software tool that would serve as a comprehensive learning resource for pre-university students, primarily high school students, who want to learn how to code. They named their project "CodeJutsu" in homage to the traditional Japanese martial art of ninjutsu, which emphasizes discipline, mastery, and continuous learning.
			  
			  The aim of the project was to showcase a collection of cognitive learning resources from across the internet and present these resources to the user to help them learn concepts of programming and coding in Python. Morgan spent countless hours researching and curating the best resources available, including tutorials, videos and exercises.
			  
			  Their final product was a web app that provided an intuitive and user-friendly interface for students to access these resources.   Morgan was thrilled to see the impact their project had on students' learning journeys. They decided to continue developing and improving the app, with the goal of reaching even more students and helping them unlock their coding potential.			</p>
